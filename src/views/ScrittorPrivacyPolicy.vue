            Here's to let you know that I am not stealing your information in any way, nor I know how to do so. Whenever you use the app to store notes, categories, name, etc. the app uses your device's own storage to store the same. When go further ahead and backup your notes using Google Drive, notes are stored in your OWN Google Drive's storage space. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Just don't go and share your phone's data with random people, I hope you don't. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I do not store your email, phone number, IP Addredss, etc. Whatever data that you input, is completely stored on your devices/ drive itself and hence you are the only one having access to the same.  
            <br>
            <br>
            There is no way in which I can see what you are doing with the app and hence you are completely in control of your privacy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, if you wish to delete your App's data from Google Drive, follow below steps: 
            <ul>
                <li>Go to drive.google.com</li>
                <li>Click on the gear in the upper right then settings</li>
                <li>Click on "Manage Apps" </li>
                <li>Scroll to find WhatsApp in the list of connected Apps</li>
                <li>Select Options then click â€œDisconnect from Drive" or,</li>
                <li>Select Options then click â€œDelete Hidden App Data" </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
